Real-Time Web Assistant Chatbot
üöÄ Overview
This project is a sophisticated, AI-driven chatbot built with Python and Streamlit. It provides real-time, accurate answers to user queries by leveraging the power of the Google Gemini API with integrated web search. The application features a secure user authentication system, including registration, 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) via email OTP, and a password reset workflow.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-Time Web Search: Instead of relying on static documents, the chatbot uses the Gemini API with Google Search grounding to fetch and synthesize up-to-date information from the internet, providing current and relevant answers.

Secure User Authentication: A complete user management system that includes:

User Registration: New users can create an account with their email and a password.

Sign-In with 2FA: Existing users sign in with their credentials, followed by a secure One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their registered email.

Forgot/Reset Password: A secure workflow allows users to reset their password via a time-sensitive link sent to their email.

Persistent User Data: User accounts are stored in a persistent SQLite database, ensuring that user information is retained between sessions and application restarts.

Content Moderation: Includes a built-in profanity filter to check user input and maintain a professional interaction environment.

Modern & Responsive UI: Built with Streamlit, the user interface is clean, modern, and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
